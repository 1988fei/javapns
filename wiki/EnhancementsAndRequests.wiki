==What's already cooking...==

Stable releases are published from time to time on the [http://code.google.com/p/javapns/downloads/list Downloads] page.  As new features are added to the project, they are committed to the trunk where they stay until they are properly tested and sufficiently stable to make it to the Downloads page.  This means that the very latest features and changes are sometimes available only in the current build from the trunk (SVN), and it remains so until they are fully tested.

If you wish to try out the very latest build of JavaPNS _(may not be production-ready)_, you can download it from [http://code.google.com/p/javapns/source/browse/trunk SVN].
