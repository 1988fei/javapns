==What's already cooking...==

Stable releases are published from time to time on the [http://code.google.com/p/javapns/downloads/list Downloads] page.  As new features are added to the project, they are committed to the trunk where they stay until they are properly tested and sufficiently stable to make it to the Downloads page.  This means that the very latest features and changes are sometimes available only in the current build from the trunk (SVN), and it remains so until they are fully tested.

If you wish to try out the very latest build of JavaPNS _(may not be production-ready)_, you can download it from [http://code.google.com/p/javapns/source/browse/trunk SVN].

====In the [http://code.google.com/p/javapns/source/browse/trunk latest build]  but not yet in the latest stable release:====
 # Support for Newsstand
 # Improved handling of blank keystore passwords
 # Improved errors for payloads exceeding the maximum size allowed
 # Ability to reject properties estimated to cause a payload to exceed its maximum size allowed
 # Fix for sending 256-byte (precisely) payloads
 # New class for running specific tests related to reported issues
 # Support for effectively disabling notification storage using payload.setExpiry(0) as per Apple specs
 # Ability to create connection pools
 # Simplified push notification error management
