=Overview=

Post a new Issue in the `Issues` tab, 
leave as much detail as possible (including code snippets!).

As issues are solved, the wiki will be expanded.

=Common Errors=
<code>!DerInputStream.getLength(): lengthTag=127, too big.</code>

Reason: This is most likely caused by the lack of having the Apple cert loaded in your keystore.

Solution for version pre-1.6: Import keystore manually as per ImportAppleCert or upgrade to version 1.6.
