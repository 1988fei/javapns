# This article explains how to simply use javapns to send notifications

= Get your certificate =

If you wanna use javapns on a pc, the first thing you have to do is exporting your certificate and you private key as a p12 file. 

To do this, just select both certificate and private key (associated to the application you wish to use to send notifications) and the right click on one item, and select "Export 2 elements", give a name (for example : _*myCertificate.p12*_) and password (for example : _*p@ssw0rd*_) and then export as p12.

Once you did this, you can now copy this p12 file on your pc (for example _*C:/temp*_).

Download javapns, and then add it to your java project classpath. To send notifications, you just need this :
<code>
PayLoad payload = new PayLoad("Hello World", "1", "default");
Device client = PushNotificationManager.getInstance().getDevice("my_iPhone");
PushNotificationManager.getInstance().initializeConnection("gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com", 2195, "C:/temp/myCertificate.p12", "p@ssw0rd", SSLConnectionHelper.KEYSTORE_TYPE_PKCS12);
PushNotificationManager.getInstance().sendNotification(client, payload);
</code>
