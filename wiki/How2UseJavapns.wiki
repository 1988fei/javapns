# This article explains how to simply use javapns to send notifications

= Get your certificate =

If you wanna use javapns on a PC, the first thing you have to do is exporting your certificate and you private key as a p12 file, using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28Mac_OS%29 KeyChain] on a MAC. 

To do this, just select both certificate and private key (associated to the application you wish to use to send notifications) in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28Mac_OS%29 KeyChain], and the right click on one item, and select "Export 2 elements", give a name (for example : _*myCertificate.p12*_) and password (for example : _*p@ssw0rd*_) and then export as p12.

Once you did this, you can now copy this p12 file on your PC (for example _*C:/temp*_).


= Working with javapns =

Download javapns, and then add it to your java project classpath. To send notifications, you just need this :
<code>
PayLoad simplePayLoad = new PayLoad();
simplePayLoad.addAlert("My alert message");
simplePayLoad.addBadge(45);
simplePayLoad.addSound("default");
Device client = PushNotificationManager.getInstance().getDevice("my_iPhone");
PushNotificationManager.getInstance().initializeConnection("gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com", 2195, "C:/temp/myCertificate.p12", "p@ssw0rd", SSLConnectionHelper.KEYSTORE_TYPE_PKCS12);
PushNotificationManager.getInstance().sendNotification(client, simplePayLoad);
</code>
And thats it, enjoy !
