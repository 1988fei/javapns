#summary Pre-1.6 version of importing Apple SSL Cert into Keystore
= Overview =
To get the keystore working... (Since the apple cert is only fetched once, it seemed like a setup issue... but 
that can be written into the java code once it is verified that all is working properly.)

_*Note:* This may need tweaking to work properly..._

== Instructions ==

Download !IntallCert: 

http://blogs.sun.com/andreas/resource/InstallCert.java

Compile it: 
<code>javac InstallCert.java</code>

Run it:
<code>java InstallCert gateway.sandbox.push.apple.com:2195</code>

then... when asked to select something...enter:
<code>1</code>

Rename it: 
<code>mv jssecacerts apple.keystore</code>

change the password: 
<code>keytool -storepasswd -keystore apple.keystore -new [your_cert_passwd] -storepasswd changeit</code>

Put the apple.keystore where the java code is expecting it. 
(see your java error logs)
