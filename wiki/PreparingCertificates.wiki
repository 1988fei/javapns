====IMPORTANT:====
*iPhone development certificate != iPhone push notification service certificate*
  There are a several iPhone certificates such as :
      * development
      * push server
      * game
When you create your SSL push service Certificate (Apple), please ensure that Enable for Apple Push Notification service is checked.

== Generate an APNS certificate ==
Step by step Instructions: [http://appnotify.com/developer/getting-started-push]

(from: [http://www.developers-life.com/apple-push-notification.html])

  * Each iPhone App requires it's own Certificate.
  * Only users with `Team Agent` access create a certificate
  * You need to create an App ID without `.*` in the iPhone developer Portal. An App ID without `.*` means its unique and works only for a single application

== Log into the iPhone Developer Program Portal ==
  # Click on `Certificates` on the left menu
  # Click on the `How To` tab
  # Scroll down to the options at the bottom of the page
  
== Certificate request ==
  # Generate a certificate signing request from your Mac's [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28Mac_OS%29 KeyChain] and save to disk
  # Upload the `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest` to the Program Portal
  # Wait for the generation of cert (about 1 min). Download the certificate (aps_developer_identity.cer) from the Program Portal
  # Keep (or rename them if you want) these 2 files in a safe place. You might need the `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest` file to request a production cert in the future or to renew it again.
  
== Export Certificate from Keychain ==
  # Import the `aps_developer_identity.cer` into [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keychain_%28Mac_OS%29 KeyChain]. 
  # Select both certificate *and* private key (associated to the application you wish to use to send notifications)
  # Right click, and select `Export 2 elements`, give a name (for example : myCertificate.p12) and password (for example : p@ssw0rd) and then export as p12.
