Source code requires the following jars: (built with Java1.6)

  * [http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_lang.cgi commons-lang-2.4.jar]
  * [http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_io.cgi commons-io-1.4.jar]
  * [http://sourceforge.net/projects/portecle/ bcprov-jdk16-145.jar]
  * [http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/download.html log4j-1.2.15.jar]

Java1.5 may work with the correct supporting libraries. (ie: bcprov)

The SSL Certificate is created by Apple from the App ID.
(See certificate [GetAPNSCertificate])

Badges will appear if the App is not running and the App is registered with the `PushNotificationService`.

All other notifications need to be handled by the App while the App is running.
