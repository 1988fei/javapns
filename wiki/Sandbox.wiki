= Useful notes about Apple's sandbox =

 # *Sandbox-specific certificate*: the SSL certificate required for communicating with the sandbox servers is NOT THE SAME as the one required for the production servers.<br /><br />
 # *Sandbox Feedback Service not listing device after app is removed*:  see [FeedbackService Feedback Service]<br /><br />
 # *Moving from sandbox to production*: once your notifications are working with the sandbox, you will naturally switch to Apple's production server.  A couple of things to watch out for when transitioning though:  
  * device tokens are not the same for sandbox and production, you need new tokens when moving to production
  * certificates are also different (see [http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/ProvisioningDevelopment/ProvisioningDevelopment.html Certificates])
  * some users have reported issues which might be solved by the procedure described on [http://www.techjini.com/blog/how-we-fixed-production-push-notifications-not-working-while-sandbox-works/ this page]
